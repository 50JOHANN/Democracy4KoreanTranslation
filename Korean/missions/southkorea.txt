description = "The First Republic of Korea or South Korea briefly became democratic in 1953, before falling under autocratic rule and collapsing in 1960. The Second Republic started as a democracy but was soon overthrown by an autocratic military regime. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Republics were nominally democratic, but in reality were more of a continuation of military rule. From 1987, the Sixth Republic has stabilized into a liberal democracy. The Korean royal family has no official authority."
